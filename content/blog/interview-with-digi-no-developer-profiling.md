Last week I had the privilege to be featured as [digi.no](www.digi.no)'s developer profile of the week. One of Norway's biggest tech website. I gave an account of my developer journey and some insights on how modern technologies has changed the way we work today.

> *I first wrote my first lines of code when I was 20, about 12 years ago, during my first year of college. Unfortunately, I never owned a computer, nor a computer game, until 2005, two years after I moved (refugee) to Norway with my family due to the civil war in Sierra Leone, my native country. Then I became a self-taught mobile app developer and IoT enthusiast.*
